Yes — you can easily search for a word or phrase across many PDFs in a folder. Here are the simplest methods depending on whether you use Windows, Mac, or command-line tools.

✅ 1. Windows: Search inside all PDFs
Method A: Built-in Windows Search

Windows can search inside PDFs if you have a PDF reader installed (Adobe Reader, Foxit, etc.).

Open the folder containing your PDFs.

In the top-right search box, type:

content:"your word here"


Example:

content:"invoice"


Windows will list only PDFs that contain that word.

Method B: Adobe Acrobat (Reader or Pro)

Open Adobe Acrobat.

Press Ctrl + Shift + F → opens Advanced Search.

Choose "All PDF Documents in" → browse and select your folder.

Type the word you want to find.

Acrobat will show all PDFs containing that word and even the page numbers.

This is the best method.

✅ 2. Mac (macOS): Spotlight Finder Search

Open Finder → go to the folder with PDFs.

In the search box type the word.

Click "Name matches" and change to "Contents".

Choose Search: This Folder.

Finder will show PDFs containing that word.

✅ 3. Using Command-Line (Windows/Linux/Mac)

If you prefer a script:

Python script (simple and free)
import PyPDF2
import os

folder = "/path/to/your/pdf/folder"
search_word = "your_word_here"

for file in os.listdir(folder):
    if file.endswith(".pdf"):
        path = os.path.join(folder, file)
        try:
            with open(path, "rb") as f:
                reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)
                for page in reader.pages:
                    text = page.extract_text() or ""
                    if search_word.lower() in text.lower():
                        print("Found in:", file)
                        break
        except:
            pass


Run it → it prints all PDFs containing the word.

✅ If you tell me:

Your operating system (Windows? Mac? Linux?)

Whether you prefer a software or a script

The word you’re trying to find

…I can give you the best exact solution for your setup.

For Windows, the BEST and most reliable method is:

✅ Adobe Acrobat → Advanced Search (Ctrl + Shift + F)

This is more accurate than Windows Search and faster than a Python script.

⭐ Why Adobe Advanced Search is the best

Searches inside every PDF reliably.

Finds hidden text, scanned text (if OCR exists).

Shows page number, preview, and context around the word.

Works even when Windows Search fails to index PDFs.

How to use it:

Open Adobe Acrobat (Reader or Pro).

Press Ctrl + Shift + F.

Select "All PDF Documents in" → choose your folder.

Type your word → Search.

Done — you get a list of all PDFs containing that word.

⭐ When Windows Search is okay:

Use Windows Search only if:

You have few PDFs

No complex layouts

Windows indexing is working
But it often misses results.

⭐ When Python script is useful:

Use Python only if:

You need to automate search regularly

You must extract data

You want a custom tool
But it requires installing libraries and is slower with large PDFs.

🎯 Final recommendation for you:
👉 Use Adobe Acrobat Advanced Search (Ctrl + Shift + F)

Fastest + Most accurate + No coding needed.

If you want, I can also create a simple Python search tool with a GUI so you can search all PDFs with a button.

Here is a simple and clean Python script that searches for any word inside all PDFs in a folder and shows which PDFs contain it.

✅ Python PDF Search Tool
Step 1 — Install required library

Open CMD or PowerShell and run:

pip install PyPDF2

✅ Step 2 — Python Script (copy & save as pdf_search.py)
import os
import PyPDF2

def search_pdf_folder(folder_path, keyword):
    keyword = keyword.lower()
    found_files = []

    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
        if filename.endswith(".pdf"):
            pdf_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
            try:
                with open(pdf_path, "rb") as f:
                    reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)
                    for page in reader.pages:
                        text = page.extract_text()
                        if text and keyword in text.lower():
                            found_files.append(filename)
                            break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Could not read {filename}: {e}")

    return found_files


if __name__ == "__main__":
    folder = input("Enter the folder path: ")
    word = input("Enter the word to search: ")

    print("\nSearching... Please wait...\n")

    results = search_pdf_folder(folder, word)

    if results:
        print("Word found in these PDF files:\n")
        for file in results:
            print(" -", file)
    else:
        print("No PDF contains this word.")

📌 How to use

Save the script as pdf_search.py

Run it:

python pdf_search.py


Enter:

Your PDF folder path

The word you want to find

It will show:

Word found in these PDF files:
 - invoice_01.pdf
 - invoice_17.pdf

⭐ Optional: Want a version with a GUI (window) so you can click a folder and type the word?

I can create that too — just tell me!

Great! Here is a Python GUI version (with a window) to search for a word inside all PDFs in a folder.

It uses Tkinter (built into Python) and PyPDF2.

✅ PDF Search Tool — GUI Version
Step 1 — Install

Run in CMD/PowerShell:

pip install PyPDF2

✅ Step 2 — Save this code as pdf_search_gui.py
import os
import PyPDF2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox, scrolledtext

def search_pdfs(folder_path, keyword):
    keyword = keyword.lower()
    matched_files = []

    for file_name in os.listdir(folder_path):
        if file_name.endswith(".pdf"):
            file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)

            try:
                with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
                    reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)
                    for page in reader.pages:
                        text = page.extract_text()
                        if text and keyword in text.lower():
                            matched_files.append(file_name)
                            break
            except:
                continue

    return matched_files

def select_folder():
    folder = filedialog.askdirectory()
    folder_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
    folder_entry.insert(0, folder)

def start_search():
    folder = folder_entry.get()
    keyword = keyword_entry.get()

    if not folder or not keyword:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please select a folder and enter a keyword.")
        return

    result_box.delete(1.0, tk.END)
    result_box.insert(tk.END, "Searching... please wait...\n\n")

    found = search_pdfs(folder, keyword)

    result_box.delete(1.0, tk.END)
    if found:
        result_box.insert(tk.END, "Keyword found in these files:\n\n")
        for f in found:
            result_box.insert(tk.END, f + "\n")
    else:
        result_box.insert(tk.END, "No PDF contains this keyword.")

# GUI Setup
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("PDF Search Tool")
root.geometry("500x400")

tk.Label(root, text="Select PDF Folder:").pack(pady=5)
folder_entry = tk.Entry(root, width=50)
folder_entry.pack(pady=5)
tk.Button(root, text="Browse", command=select_folder).pack(pady=5)

tk.Label(root, text="Enter word to search:").pack(pady=5)
keyword_entry = tk.Entry(root, width=30)
keyword_entry.pack(pady=5)

tk.Button(root, text="Search", command=start_search).pack(pady=10)

result_box = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(root, width=60, height=12)
result_box.pack(pady=10)

root.mainloop()

🎉 How it works

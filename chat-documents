Yes, you can implement that restriction by tracking the player's completed levels per chapter and mode. Here's how to set up chapter unlock conditions based on the criteria you mentioned:

✅ Your Condition

To unlock Chapter 2, the player must have:

Completed at least 10 Easy levels

And at least 5 Medium levels
(from Chapter 1)

🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation
✅ 1. Track Level Completion

In your state, add a new key to track completed levels:

let state = {
  ...
  completedLevels: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("completedLevels")) || {}, // NEW
  ...
};

✅ 2. Save Completed Levels on Finish

Inside loadLevel() or right after the player completes a level (where you already check if (state.found.length === diffs().length)), add this:

const key = `${state.selectedChapter.chapter}-${state.selectedMode}-${state.currentLevel}`;
if (!state.completedLevels[key]) {
    state.completedLevels[key] = true;
    save("completedLevels", state.completedLevels);
}


This ensures that every completed level is stored by chapter-mode-index.

✅ 3. Check Chapter Unlock Eligibility

Create a function:

function canUnlockChapter(nextChapterNumber) {
    const required = {
        easy: 10,
        medium: 5
    };

    const completed = {
        easy: 0,
        medium: 0
    };

    Object.keys(state.completedLevels).forEach(key => {
        const [chapter, mode] = key.split("-");
        if (parseInt(chapter) === nextChapterNumber - 1) {
            if (mode === "easy") completed.easy++;
            if (mode === "medium") completed.medium++;
        }
    });

    return completed.easy >= required.easy && completed.medium >= required.medium;
}

✅ 4. Modify Chapter Button Display

Inside your showChapterSelectScreen() function, update the button creation logic like so:

btn.disabled = chapter.chapter > state.unlockedChapter ||
    (chapter.chapter === state.unlockedChapter + 1 && !canUnlockChapter(chapter.chapter));


This prevents unlocking Chapter 2 until the required levels from Chapter 1 are completed.

✅ 5. Optionally Auto-Unlock Chapter

You can automatically unlock chapters in endGame(true) when they qualify:

Replace this part:

if (win && state.currentLevel >= state.activeLevels.length - 1 && state.selectedChapter?.chapter === state.unlockedChapter) {
    state.unlockedChapter++;
    save("unlockedChapter", state.unlockedChapter);
}


With this:

if (
    state.selectedChapter?.chapter === state.unlockedChapter &&
    canUnlockChapter(state.unlockedChapter + 1)
) {
    state.unlockedChapter++;
    save("unlockedChapter", state.unlockedChapter);
}

Yes — you can absolutely make this game look and feel like a polished, real game, with some focused UI/UX improvements and structural enhancements. You're already very close with the current code — it’s functional, modular, and scalable.

✅ Here's How to Make It Look Like a "Real Game"
🎮 1. Visual Progression System

Show player's chapter progression like a campaign map or level tree.

✅ Progress bar per chapter with stars (★) showing levels completed.

✅ Lock icons 🔒 on chapters/modes that aren't unlocked.

✅ Show ✅ / ✖️ / ⭐ next to each level in level select.

➕ Add to showLevelSelectScreen():
// After creating each level button
if (state.completedLevels[`${state.selectedChapter.chapter}-${state.selectedMode}-${idx}`]) {
    btn.innerHTML += " ✅";
}

✨ 2. Animated Transitions

Use CSS animations or fades when changing screens.

.screen {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.4s ease-in-out;
}
.screen.active {
  opacity: 1;
  display: flex;
}


Then toggle .active class in JS to fade in/out screens.

🔥 3. Juicy Game Feedback

Already using fireworks and sparkles! Now add:

Shake effect on wrong click:

@keyframes shake {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateX(0); }
  20%, 60% { transform: translateX(-10px); }
  40%, 80% { transform: translateX(10px); }
}
.shake {
  animation: shake 0.4s;
}


Add els.rightCanvas.classList.add('shake') and remove it after 500ms.

Combo meter UI:
Show 🔥 Combo x3! at top-center, fade out after 1s.

🏆 4. Achievements & Goals

Track and show things like:

"Found 50 differences!"

"Completed 10 Easy levels"

"Unlocked all Medium levels in Chapter 1"

Just track these in localStorage and show a modal or toast when unlocked.

🎨 5. Better Theming

Add CSS themes that feel more "game-like" (e.g. neon, dark mode with particles, or day/night cycles), and allow player to toggle.

You can use CSS variables:

:root {
  --bg-color: #fff;
  --accent: #5aafff;
}
body.dark-theme {
  --bg-color: #121212;
  --accent: #00f0ff;
}


Then apply in all styles like:

body {
  background-color: var(--bg-color);
}
button {
  background-color: var(--accent);
}

🎵 6. Background Music & Sounds

You're already playing sound on events — just add looping ambient music:

const backgroundMusic = new Audio('music/loop.mp3');
backgroundMusic.loop = true;
backgroundMusic.volume = 0.3;
if (state.musicOn) backgroundMusic.play();


Allow volume control & mute toggle.

📲 7. Mobile-Friendly UI

Improve with:

Larger touch targets (44px min)

Mobile-optimized layout with media queries

Add fullscreen mode

function goFullscreen() {
  const el = document.documentElement;
  if (el.requestFullscreen) el.requestFullscreen();
}

📦 8. Persistent Player Profile

Save things like:

Player name

Total time played

Total stars

Unlocked chapters, completed levels

Then display it on start screen like:

Welcome back, Alex!
Stars: ⭐️ x25 | Chapters Unlocked: 3

🧠 9. Tutorial & First-Time UX

Show a quick tutorial overlay when player first starts.

if (!localStorage.getItem("seenTutorial")) {
  showTutorialOverlay();
  localStorage.setItem("seenTutorial", "yes");
}

🏁 10. Endgame / Completion Feedback

Once player completes all levels in a chapter or the entire game:

Show endgame animation / cutscene / celebration

Congratulate with stats:
You've found 150 differences in total! 🎉

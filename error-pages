Here is a complete list of the common HTTP error status codes (especially the ones that usually have an “error page” like 404, 419, etc.).
These are grouped by category for clarity.

Here is a clean, simple, short description for every major HTTP error code (4xx + 5xx).
This is the easiest and clearest version to understand.

✅ 4xx – Client Error Codes (User-side issues)
400 – Bad Request

The server can’t understand the request due to invalid syntax.

401 – Unauthorized

Login or authentication is required.

402 – Payment Required

Reserved for future use; sometimes used for paid access.

403 – Forbidden

Access is denied even if authenticated.

404 – Not Found

The requested page or resource does not exist.

405 – Method Not Allowed

The HTTP method (GET/POST/etc.) is not allowed for this URL.

406 – Not Acceptable

The server can't return a response matching the client's request format.

407 – Proxy Authentication Required

Client must authenticate with a proxy.

408 – Request Timeout

The client took too long to send the request.

409 – Conflict

Conflict in the request (e.g., editing a resource at the same time).

410 – Gone

The resource used to exist but is permanently deleted.

411 – Length Required

Request is missing the required “Content-Length” header.

412 – Precondition Failed

Preconditions in request headers were not met.

413 – Payload Too Large

Request body is too large for the server to handle.

414 – URI Too Long

The URL is too long.

415 – Unsupported Media Type

The server doesn’t support the media type sent in the request.

416 – Range Not Satisfiable

The requested portion of a file is invalid.

417 – Expectation Failed

Expectation in the “Expect” header cannot be met.

418 – I'm a Teapot (Fun code)

A joke code; server refuses to brew coffee in a teapot.

419 – Page Expired / Session Timeout

Used by some frameworks (Laravel) when CSRF token/session expires.

421 – Misdirected Request

The request was sent to the wrong server.

422 – Unprocessable Content

The server understands the request but validation fails.

423 – Locked

The resource is locked and cannot be accessed.

424 – Failed Dependency

A previous request failed, so this request cannot continue.

425 – Too Early

Server refuses to process because request may be replayed.

426 – Upgrade Required

Client must upgrade protocol (e.g., switch to HTTPS or HTTP/2).

428 – Precondition Required

<canvas id="gameCanvas" width="300" height="500"></canvas>
<script>
const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let ball = { x: 150, y: 50, radius: 20, dx: 0, dy: 0 };

window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', (e) => {
    // gamma = left/right tilt
    ball.dx = e.gamma / 10;
    // beta = front/back tilt
    ball.dy = e.beta / 10;
});

function update() {
    ball.x += ball.dx;
    ball.y += ball.dy;

    // simple boundary check
    if(ball.x < ball.radius) ball.x = ball.radius;
    if(ball.x > canvas.width - ball.radius) ball.x = canvas.width - ball.radius;
    if(ball.y < ball.radius) ball.y = ball.radius;
    if(ball.y > canvas.height - ball.radius) ball.y = canvas.height - ball.radius;

    draw();
    requestAnimationFrame(update);
}

function draw() {
    ctx.clearRect(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height);
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(ball.x, ball.y, ball.radius, 0, Math.PI*2);
    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.closePath();
}

update();
</script>

Absolutely! Let’s go step by step and break down this piece of code from scratch so you understand exactly what it does and how you can use it in your game.

The Code
window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', (e) => {
    // gamma = left/right tilt
    ball.dx = e.gamma / 10;
    // beta = front/back tilt
    ball.dy = e.beta / 10;
});

1. window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', callback)

window.addEventListener is a way to listen for events in the browser.

'deviceorientation' is a special event fired when the device (phone/tablet) is tilted.

The callback function (e) => { ... } is called every time the device orientation changes.

So basically: this listens for your phone tilting and gives you the tilt data in e.

2. e.gamma and e.beta

The e object contains the orientation data:

Property	What it measures	Range (approx.)	How it can be used
e.gamma	Left/right tilt of the device	-90° (left) to 90° (right)	Move your ball/platform horizontally
e.beta	Front/back tilt of the device	-180° (up) to 180° (down)	Move your ball/platform vertically
e.alpha	Rotation around vertical axis	0° to 360°	Compass direction, optional for balance game

💡 Tip: For most mobile balance games, you mainly use gamma (left/right) for horizontal movement.

3. ball.dx = e.gamma / 10

ball.dx represents how much the ball moves horizontally per frame.

Dividing by 10 slows the movement down, because e.gamma can be a big number, and moving the ball that much would be too fast.

Example:

e.gamma = 20 → ball.dx = 2 → ball moves 2 pixels per frame.

4. ball.dy = e.beta / 10

Similarly, ball.dy is the vertical movement of the ball.

e.beta tells how much the phone is tilted forward/backward.

Dividing by 10 makes the movement smoother.

5. How this affects your game

Detect tilt: Your game now knows how the player is tilting the phone.

Move the ball: You can use ball.dx and ball.dy in your game loop to update the ball’s position:

ball.x += ball.dx;
ball.y += ball.dy;


Add boundaries: Prevent the ball from falling off the screen.

Things you can do with this

Move a ball or object in response to phone tilt.

Make a balance game like “Ball on a platform.”

Add obstacles or collectibles that the ball interacts with.

Adjust sensitivity by changing the /10 to /20 (slower) or /5 (faster).

6. Mouse / Drag Control

Player can click and drag the ball or an on-screen platform.

Works on both desktop and mobile (with touch events).

let dragging = false;

canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', e => dragging = true);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', e => dragging = false);
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', e => {
    if(dragging){
        ball.x = e.clientX;
        ball.y = e.clientY;
    }
});


✅ Very intuitive for drag-and-drop games.
✅ Works for touch by also listening to touchstart, touchmove, touchend.

7. Gamepad / Controller Support

Use a physical controller (Xbox, PlayStation, etc.) connected to the device.

JavaScript has the Gamepad API
.

window.addEventListener("gamepadconnected", (e) => {
    console.log("Gamepad connected:", e.gamepad);
});

function update() {
    const gp = navigator.getGamepads()[0];
    if(gp){
        ball.dx = gp.axes[0] * 5; // left stick horizontal
        ball.dy = gp.axes[1] * 5; // left stick vertical
    }
    requestAnimationFrame(update);
}
update();


✅ Excellent for desktop or advanced users.
✅ Can give analog control (smooth movement).

8. Voice Control (Experimental)

Use speech recognition for commands like "left", "right", "up", "down".

Uses the Web Speech API:

const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = true;

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
    const command = event.results[event.results.length-1][0].transcript.trim();
    if(command === "left") ball.dx = -5;
    if(command === "right") ball.dx = 5;
};
recognition.start();


✅ Fun and experimental!
❌ Not very precise for fast games.

9. Sensor Fusion / Motion Controller

Use gyroscope, accelerometer, or external sensors (like Arduino, Bluetooth devices).

Could make a custom balance board game or a real-world input controller.

Yes, finding differences manually and marking their (x, y) positions can be very time-consuming. To make this process faster and more efficient for your photo hunt game, you can use image processing techniques to automatically detect the differences between the two images.

Here’s a complete and practical solution for your workflow:

✅ Goal:

From two similar images (left and right), automatically detect the differences, and output:

x, y position of the difference (center of the changed area)

radius (size of the spot, roughly)

shape (if needed, optional detection)

🔧 Solution Approach

We'll use the following tools in Python:

OpenCV to process the images

scikit-image or built-in methods for comparing images

Optional: draw the output to visualize the result

⚙️ Steps:

Load the left and right images

Convert to grayscale

Compute absolute difference

Threshold and contour detection

Extract bounding boxes / centroids

Format output as JSON (x, y, radius)

▶️ Let's do it now using the image you uploaded.

I'll process the image and find differences now.

To process your image and detect differences automatically, you'll need to use Python with image processing libraries like OpenCV and scikit-image. Since you're not currently logged into ChatGPT with Python access, you can run the following code on your own machine.

🧠 Here's the Full Python Script to Detect Differences
import cv2
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from skimage.metrics import structural_similarity as ssim

# Load your combined image (side-by-side left and right)
image_path = "your_combined_image.png"  # Replace with your file path
image = Image.open(image_path)
image_np = np.array(image)

# Split the image into left and right parts
height, width, _ = image_np.shape
mid = width // 2
left_img = image_np[:, :mid]
right_img = image_np[:, mid:]

# Convert to grayscale
left_gray = cv2.cvtColor(left_img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
right_gray = cv2.cvtColor(right_img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)

# Compute Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
(score, diff) = ssim(left_gray, right_gray, full=True)
diff = (diff * 255).astype("uint8")

# Threshold the diff image
thresh = cv2.threshold(diff, 220, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)[1]

# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Process contours and extract difference positions
differences = []
for c in contours:
if cv2.contourArea(c) > 50:
x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(c)
center_x = x + w // 2
center_y = y + h // 2
radius = max(w, h) // 2
differences.append({
"x": int(center_x),
"y": int(center_y),
"radius": int(radius)
})

# Sort by position for consistency
differences = sorted(differences, key=lambda d: (d["x"], d["y"]))

# Print the results
print("Detected differences:")
for diff in differences:
print(diff)

🧪 Requirements

Make sure you install the needed libraries:

pip install opencv-python scikit-image pillow numpy
